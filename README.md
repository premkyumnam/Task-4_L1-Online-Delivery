  <h1>Task#4_Level#1: ONLINE DELIVERY ANALYSIS</h1>
    
  <h2>Projec Review: </h2>
In this project, I analyzed a restaurant dataset to identify food trends. The goal of this 4th task is to:

1. Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer online delivey. And
2. Compare the average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery 

<h1>Tools & Technologies:</h1>

To achieve this, I used the following tools and technologies:

1. Python: Programming language
2. Pandas: For data analysis, cleaning, exploration, and manipulation.
3. NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
4. Matplotlib: For data visualization, including plots, charts, and graphs.
5. Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, building on Matplotlib.
6. Jupyter Notebook(IDEs): As the primary environment for data processing and analysis.<br><br>
These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.</p>

<h1>Results:</h1>
<p>First,I tried to find out the total number of restaurants using <br> "total_resutaurants=len(df)"<br><br> And then,  I got the total number of restaurants that do not offer online delivery i.e., 7091  and <br>the total number of restaurant that offer online delivery is 2451. <br>And tried to find out the percentage of restaurants that offer and do not offer online delivery I used this Python code <br><br><br>
  "online_delivery_percenatge=(online_delivery_counts/total no. of restaurants)*100<br>
  "Finally, I identified the required results of the task2:<br>
1. The percentage of </b><br>
