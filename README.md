  <h1> Second Task of Level 1</h1>
    
  <h2>Projec Review: </h2>
In this project, I analyzed a restaurant dataset to identify food trends. The goal of this second task was to:

1. Identify the city with the highest number of restaurants in the dataset
2. Calculate the average rating for restaurants in each city. And
3. Determine the city with the highest average rating.

<h1>Tools & Technologies:</h1>

To achieve this, I used the following tools and technologies:

1. Python: Programming language
2. Pandas: For data analysis, cleaning, exploration, and manipulation.
3. NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
4. Matplotlib: For data visualization, including plots, charts, and graphs.
5. Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, building on Matplotlib.
6. Jupyter Notebook(IDEs): As the primary environment for data processing and analysis.<br><br>
These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.</p>

<h1>Results:</h1>
<p>Finally, I identified the required results of the task2:<br>
1. The city with the highest number of restaurants cin the dataset is <b>New Delhi (5473 restaurants) </b><br>
2. The average rating for restaurants in each city are:<br><br>
