  <h1> Second Task of Level 1</h1>
    
  <h2>Projec Review: </h2>
In this project, I analyzed a restaurant dataset to identify food trends. The goal of this 4th task is to:

1. Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer online delivey. And
2. Compare the average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery 

<h1>Tools & Technologies:</h1>

To achieve this, I used the following tools and technologies:

1. Python: Programming language
2. Pandas: For data analysis, cleaning, exploration, and manipulation.
3. NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
4. Matplotlib: For data visualization, including plots, charts, and graphs.
5. Seaborn: For statistical data visualization, building on Matplotlib.
6. Jupyter Notebook(IDEs): As the primary environment for data processing and analysis.<br><br>
These tools enabled me to effectively extract insights and meaning from the data.</p>

<h1>Results:</h1>
<p>First,I tried to find out the total number of restaurants using "total_resutaurants=len(df)"<br><br> And then,  I got the total number of restaurants that do not offer online delivery i.e., 7091  and the total number of restaurant that offer online delivery is 2451. And tried to find out the percentage of restaurants that offer and do not offer online delivery I used this Python code <br><br>
  "online_delivery_percenatge=(online_delivery_counts/total no. of restaurants)*100
  "Finally, I identified the required results of the task2:<br>
1. The percentage of </b><br>
2. The average rating for restaurants in each city are:<br><br>
